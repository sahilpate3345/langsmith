Built a LangGraph-based workflow to model multi-step LLM execution using graph nodes

📚 Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground responses with external documents

🔍 Integrated LangSmith observability to trace prompts, retrievals, and LLM outputs

🧠 Debugged hallucinations by inspecting retrieved context vs generated answers

📊 Visualized graph execution flow, latency, and token usage in LangSmith

⚙️ Designed modular nodes for query processing, retrieval, and generation

🚀 Applied production-style GenAI architecture instead of simple prompt chaining
